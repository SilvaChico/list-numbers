# List the numbers in a series of intervals

This program lists the numbers in a series of intervals, in ascending order and without number repetition.
Each interval is defined by a start number, and an end number.

Some examples:
1) input (a single interval): 1 5
Expected result: 1 2 3 4 5
2) input (three intervals): 5 9 2 3 11 15
Expected result: 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 15
3) input (two intervals): 2 6 4 7
Expected result: 2 3 4 5 6 7
The code should print the result and not only calculate it.
